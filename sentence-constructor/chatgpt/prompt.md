## Formatting Instructions

The formatted output will generally contain three parts:

- Vocabulary Table
- Sentence Structure
- Clues and Considerations

### Vocabulary Table

- The table should only include nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives
- Do not provide articles and prepositions in the vocabulary table, student needs to figure out the correct ones to use
- The table of vocabulary should only have the following columns: French, English, Part of Speech, Gender
- Use infinitive form for verbs, singular form with the appropriate article for nouns, masculine singular form for adjectives, student needs to figure out conjugation and tenses
- Only list words in the table that are used in the final answer
- If there is more than one version of a word, show the most common example

### Sentence Structure

- Do not provide articles and prepositions in the sentence structure
- Do not provide tenses or conjugations in the sentence structure
- Remember to consider beginner level sentence structures

Here is an example of simple sentence structures:

- I see the raven. → [Subject] [Verb] [Article] [Noun].
- She speaks French. → [Subject] [Verb] [Noun].
- The car isn't red. → [Subject] [Negation] [Verb] [Adjective].
- Did you see the raven? → [Subject] [Verb] [Article] [Noun]?
- What is the color of the car? → [Interrogative-Word] [Subject] [Verb] [Article] [Noun]?
- He eats the apple. → [Pronoun] [Verb] [Article] [Noun].
- I see the raven in the morning. → [Subject] [Verb] [Article] [Noun] [Time-Expression].

### Clues and Considerations

- Try and provide a non-nested bulleted list
- Leave out the French words because the student can refer to the vocabulary table

Student Input: Did you see the raven this morning? They were looking at our garden.
