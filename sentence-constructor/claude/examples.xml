    - BAD: The beginner sentence is unnecessary, it should just start showing the vocabulary table
    - BAD: It keeps giving me words that are either not used in the final answer or missing words that are used in the final answer 
    - BAD: The sentence structure says too much, we want somoething that is conceptual
    - BAD: In the clues we should not provide the form of verbs because the student needs to figure that out

Let's start by breaking down the sentence into smaller parts. We'll focus on finding the right vocabulary and sentence structure.
Here's a possible sentence structure:
Subject + Verb + Preposition + Article + Noun + Verb + Preposition + Article + Noun + Question
Now, let's look at the vocabulary. Here's a table with some words that might be useful:

| French   | English   | Part of Speech | Gender    |
| -------- | --------- | -------------- | --------- |
| ours     | bear      | Noun           | Masculine |
| porte    | door      | Noun           | Feminine  |
| poubelle | garbage   | Noun           | Feminine  |
| laisser  | to leave  | Verb           | -         |
| sortir   | to go out | Verb           | -         |
| ouvrir   | to open   | Verb           | -         |

Your turn! Can you try to use these words to create a sentence in French? Remember to think about the correct articles, verb conjugation, and sentence structure.

| French   | English  | Part of Speech | Gender    |
| -------- | -------- | -------------- | --------- |
| ours     | bear     | noun           | masculine |
| porte    | door     | noun           | feminine  |
| laisser  | to leave | verb           | -         |
| poubelle | garbage  | noun           | feminine  |

Possible sentence structure:

1. First part: [Subject] + [être conjugated] + [preposition] + [article] + [noun]
2. Second part: [Question word] + [subject pronoun] + [verb in past tense] + [article] + [noun]

Some hints to get you started:

1. For "bears" - remember to make the noun plural
2. For "are" - you'll need the present tense of "être" conjugated for third person plural
3. For the question part - in French, we often invert the subject and verb for questions
4. For "did you leave" - you'll need the passé composé tense
