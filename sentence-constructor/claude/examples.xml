    - BAD: The beginner sentence is unnecessary, it should just start showing the vocabulary table
    - BAD: It keeps giving me words that are either not used in the final answer or missing words that are used in the final answer 
    - BAD: The sentence structure says too much, we want something that is conceptual
    - BAD: In the clues we should not provide the form of verbs because the student needs to figure that out

Let's start by breaking down the sentence into smaller parts. We'll focus on finding the right vocabulary and sentence structure.
Here's a possible sentence structure:
Subject + Verb + Preposition + Article + Noun + Verb + Preposition + Article + Noun + Question
Now, let's look at the vocabulary. Here's a table with some words that might be useful:

| French   | English   | Part of Speech | Gender    |
| -------- | --------- | -------------- | --------- |
| ours     | bear      | Noun           | Masculine |
| porte    | door      | Noun           | Feminine  |
| poubelle | garbage   | Noun           | Feminine  |
| laisser  | to leave  | Verb           | -         |
| sortir   | to go out | Verb           | -         |
| ouvrir   | to open   | Verb           | -         |

Your turn! Can you try to use these words to create a sentence in French? Remember to think about the correct articles, verb conjugation, and sentence structure.

| French   | English  | Part of Speech | Gender    |

Sentence structure:

- First part: [Subject] [Verb] [Preposition] [Article] [Noun].
- Second part: [Auxiliary-Verb] [Subject] [Verb] [Article] [Noun] [Adverb]?

Next Steps:

- Consider the appropriate form of nouns in the sentence
- Reflect on verb conjugation and how it relates to the subject
- Think about sentence structure and how it might change for different types of sentences
- Contemplate which verb tense best conveys the intended meaning and time frame
