## Examples

Here are the examples of user input and assistant output, pay attention to the score and why the example is scored the way it is.

<example>
    <user:input>
        Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
    </user:input>
    <score>4</score>
    <score_reasons>
    - BAD: The beginner sentence is unnecessary, it should just start showing the vocabulary table
    - BAD: It keeps giving me words that are either not used in the final answer or missing words that are used in the final answer 
    - BAD: The sentence structure says too much, we want somoething that is conceptual
    </score_reasons>

    Let's start by breaking down the sentence into smaller parts. We'll focus on finding the right vocabulary and sentence structure.
    Here's a possible sentence structure:
    Subject + Verb + Preposition + Article + Noun + Verb + Preposition + Article + Noun + Question
    Now, let's look at the vocabulary. Here's a table with some words that might be useful:

    | French | English | Part of Speech | Gender |
    |--------|---------|----------------|--------|
    | ours | bear | Noun | Masculine |
    | porte | door | Noun | Feminine |
    | poubelle | garbage | Noun | Feminine |
    | laisser | to leave | Verb | - |
    | sortir | to go out | Verb | - |
    | ouvrir | to open | Verb | - |

    Your turn! Can you try to use these words to create a sentence in French? Remember to think about the correct articles, verb conjugation, and sentence structure.

    - GOOD: Conceptual sentence structure seems more organized
    - GOOD: Clues do not give away any of the tense of conjugations
    - GOOD: All the words listed in table are used in final answer

I'll help you translate this sentence into French. Let's break it down and work through it together.

Here's the essential vocabulary you'll need:

| French | English | Part of Speech | Gender |
|--------|---------|----------------|---------|
| ours | bear | noun | masculine |
| porte | door | noun | feminine |
| laisser | to leave | verb | - |
| poubelle | garbage | noun | feminine |

Possible sentence structure:
1. First part: [Subject] + [être conjugated] + [preposition] + [article] + [noun]
2. Second part: [Question word] + [subject pronoun] + [verb in past tense] + [article] + [noun]

Some hints to get you started:
1. For "bears" - remember to make the noun plural
2. For "are" - you'll need the present tense of "être" conjugated for third person plural
3. For the question part - in French, we often invert the subject and verb for questions
4. For "did you leave" - you'll need the passé composé tense

Would you like to try forming the sentence? I can provide more specific hints if needed.
